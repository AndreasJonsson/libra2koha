=head1 NAME

libra2koha - Tools for migrating data from the Libra ILS to Koha. 

=head1 DATA FROM LIBRA

After you get your data exported from Libra, you get a bunch of .txt files. 
Most of these follow this pattern:

=over 4

=item * F<Something.txt> - data from the table Something.

=item * F<Somethingspec.txt> - specification of the columns in the Something table.

=back

Files that do not follow this pattern:

=over 4

=item * F<exportCat.txt> - bibliographic records in some variataion of 
mnemonic/line mode MARC format

=item * F<exportCatMatch.txt> - mapping between IdCat (a simple, numeric
identifier used to connect e.g. items to records (via Items.IdCat)) and the
concatenated contents of 001 and 003. So if you know the 001 and 003 of a record
you can concatenate that and look it up in this file, and get the numeric
identifier that you can use to look up items connected to the record.

=back

=head1 TYPES OF DATA

B<libra2koha> currently handles the following types of data:

=over 4

=item * Bibliographic records and items

=item * Borrowers

=item * Active issues/loans

=back

=head1 WORKFLOW

The main script in this repository is F<libra2koha.sh>. In theory it is the
only script you should need to run directly. It will run all the other scripts
and transformations required to do the migration.

The main idea is that you run F<libra2koha.sh> twice. The first time it will
complain about some missing config and mapping files, but also produce stubs
for those same files. After you have filled in the stub files you run 
F<libra2koha.sh> again, and the migration produces a set of output files that
can be loaded into Koha. 

=head2 First run

Before you run F<libra2koha.sh> for the first time you need to have two 
directories set up:

=over 4

=item * A config directory, which should be empty initially

=item * The directory that contains the data dump from Libra

=back

When you have these set up, you can run F<libra2koha.sh> thusly: 

  libra2koha.sh /path/to/config /path/to/data

As mentioned earlier, this will complain about missing files, but it will also
generate stubs for these files in /path/to/config. When this is done, you have to
go through all the stub files and fill in the blanks. This will typically also
involve filling Koha with corresponding settings, like values for the LOC and
CCODE authorized values. 

The format of the generated files will look something like this:

  # Generated from /path/to/data/utf8/Departments.txt
  # 2015-10-14 11:31:40
  
  1: '' # Something 
  2: '' # Something else
  3: '' # Another one

On the left are actual values/IDs from Libra. These should not be changed. On
the right are textual explanations of what the values/IDs represent. Your job is
to fill in the empty quotes with something that makes sense to Koha. What this
is depends on the file:

=over 4

=item * F<config.yaml> - This is the main config file, and does not follow the
pattern described above. Look at the comments and names of variables to figure
out if any changes are necessary. 

=item * F<branchcodes.yaml> - All the libraries/branches. Define all the 
libraries/branches you need in Koha, under  Administration > Libraries and 
groups. Fill in the "Code" for each library in the blank quotes.

=item * F<loc.yaml> - Authorized values of the "LOC" category. Fill in the 
"Authorized value" of each value into the blank quotes.

=item * F<ccode.yaml> - Authorized values of the "CCODE" category. Fill in the 
"Authorized value" of each value into the blank quotes.

=item * F<patroncategories.yaml> - Go to Administration > Patron categories in 
Koha and create the categories you need. Fill in the "Code" for each category
in the blank quotes.

=back

=head2 Second run

When all the configs and mappings are in place, you should run F<libra2koha.sh>
in exactly the same way as earlier: 

  libra2koha.sh /path/to/config /path/to/data

This should produce a bunch of output files in /path/to/data/out

=head2 Caveat

In thoery, your data should now be fully migrated and ready to be loaded into 
Koha. In practice you might run into problems that mean you have to tweak the
configs and mappings and run F<libra2koha.sh> multiple times to get the 
desired results. You might even have to tweak the scripts before you are
perfectly happy. Your mileage WILL wary!

=head1 GETTING THE DATA INTO KOHA

The data needs to be loaded into Koha in the right order:



=head1 DATABASE

When the data dumped from Libra are going to be used, they are loaded into a
MySQL databse, before being extracted and massaged. The scripts are currently
hardcoded to use a database on localhost with the following credentials:

=over 4

=item * databasename = libra2koha

=item * username = libra2koha

=item * password = pass

=back

If you have MySQL installed, you should be able to create the necessary database
and user with the following commands:

  $ mysql -u root -p
  mysql> create database libra2koha;
  mysql> grant all privileges on libra2koha.* to 'libra2koha'@'localhost' identified by 'pass';
  mysql> flush privileges;

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

The scripts in this repository rely on some resources not included in the repo
itself:

=head2 A Linux environment

The tools have all been successfully run on Ubuntu 14.04. 

=head2 LibrioTools

This is a collection of tools createed by Libriotech. It can be obtained thusly:

  git clone https://github.com/Libriotech/LibrioTools.git

=head1 MORE DOCUMENTATION

All the provided Perl files have embedded documentation in the form of POD. To
read this documentation, run the files through C<perldoc>:

=head2 Main scripts

These are the scripts that play an active part in the migration:

  perldoc records.pl
  perldoc borrowers.pl
  perldoc issues.pl

=head2 Helper scripts

These are used for minor tasks during the migration:
  
  perldoc analyze00x.pl
  perldoc create_tables.pl
  perldoc fix_borrowers.pl
  perldoc itemtypes.pl
  perldoc table2config.pl
